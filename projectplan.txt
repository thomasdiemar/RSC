Project Plan: Implement Bounded Simplex with Phase I/II and Lexicographic Locking

1) Clarify requirements & constraints [Done]
- Variables are continuous in [0,1] (no integer branching for now).
- Non-commanded axes are hard equalities to zero; commanded axes are objectives (max/min).
- Maintain lexicographic priorities: solve higher priority goals, lock achieved value as equality for subsequent goals.
- Respect allowed namespaces; no MSF dependencies.

2) Design the tableau & data flow [Done]
- Define a simplex tableau: basis/nonbasis, RHS, objective row, bounds per variable.
- Map 6×N matrix to constraints: hard axes as equalities (desired or 0); target axis as the objective row for phase II.
- Represent soft rows (NaN) as soft penalties or skip them in the hard constraint set for phase I.

3) Implement Phase I (feasible start) [In progress]
- Add artificial variables for each equality to drive feasibility. (pending)
- Phase I objective: minimize sum of artificial variables. (pending)
- Pivot until artificials leave the basis or are zero; fail if infeasible. (pending)
- Enforce bounds [0,1] on real variables during pivots. (pending)
- Current scaffolding: added BoundedSimplexTableau (equality row tracking) and BoundedSimplexSolver with lower-bound init and a basic feasibility adjustment loop.

4) Implement Phase II (optimize target) [Pending]
- Set objective to maximize/minimize the target row result.
- Use bounded simplex: compute reduced costs, select entering, ratio test with bounds, update basis.
- Terminate on optimality; detect unbounded/infeasible.

5) Lexicographic locking [Pending]
- After phase II for a priority, record achieved target value and convert that row into an equality (RHS locked).
- Proceed to the next priority and repeat phase I/II with locked constraints.

6) Integration [Pending]
- Wire LexicographicGoalSolver.Solve to build tableau per command, run phase I/II per priority, and stream progress.
- Replace current enumerative/LS paths; remove binary corner search.

7) Testing & validation [Pending]
- Re-enable all tests: core 12-thruster, 3Fx/3Opp/4Fx, Random/Random2.
- Compare thruster outputs/resultant force/torque to MSF; add tie-breakers (e.g., minimize total thrust on ties).
- Add targeted unit tests for phase I feasibility (zero commands) and bounded optimality (hit 0 or 1 bounds).

8) Cleanup & docs [Pending]
- Update comments to reflect the new simplex flow.
- Ensure no MSF references in Custom.GoalProgramming; keep within allowed namespaces.
- Document known limitations (no integer branching).
