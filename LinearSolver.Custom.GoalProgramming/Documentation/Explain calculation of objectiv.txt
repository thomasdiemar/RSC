Explain calculation of objective and net evaluation row value in each step for minimization. 
For priority 1 Show simplex table each step, explicit make every varible a basic varible, show Torque Tx,Ty,Tz in table as Basic Varibles, no shortcuts. Dont show and use show Fx,Fy,Fz and A1, A2 or other artificial.
Focus on highlighting in yellow all operations reqarding Augmented ratio test (bounded feature) in simplex table.
Focus on highlighting in green all operations regarding objective.
Focus on highlighting in blue all operations regarding choosing the entering variable
Focus on highlighting in red all discovered constraints and their influence on the table.
Show all variable LB and UB status.
User thrusters, cancel torque:
r1 = (2, 2, 0)  a1 = (100, 100, 100)
r2 = (-2, -2, 0) a2 = (100, 100, 100)
r3 = (0, 2, 2)  a3 = (100, 100, 100)
r4 = (0, -2, -2) a4 = (100, 100, 100)
For priority 2: When torque canceled, add found constraints for torque. Explain constraints torque. Show calculation of objective and net evaluation row value in each step for minimization. 
Show simplex table each step, explicit make every varible a basic varible, show locked Torque and Force Fx,Fy,Fz in table as Basic Varibles, no shortcuts. Set bounds t1 to 0.5


2.
explain ART in very small details, leave nothing out. Show all possible variations. Why are 2 nonbasic variables effected by on instance of selected column

All other nonbasic variables do not move at all.
(If it looks like another “nonbasic” moved, that means in your current basis that second variable is actually basic via some equality row—e.g., a coupling constraint.)


Explain in detail degenerate row pivot
