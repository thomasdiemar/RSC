## Summary

Resolves the 'Could not install package' error caused by missing framework targeting in NuGet packages.

## Changes

- Created explicit `.nuspec` files with proper `.NETFramework4.7.2` targeting for:
  - `LinearSolver` (1.0.0)
  - `LinearSolver.Custom` (1.0.0)
  - `RCS` (2.0.0)

- Enhanced NuGet metadata in `LinearSolver.Custom.csproj`:
  - Added symbol package support
  - Added explicit include symbols configuration

- Updated publish workflow to:
  - Install NuGet CLI 6.8.0
  - Use `.nuspec` files instead of `.csproj` for packing
  - Ensures consistent framework targeting across all packages

## Technical Details

The previous publish workflow used `nuget pack` on `.csproj` files without explicit framework targeting. This caused NuGet to generate packages with incomplete or incorrect framework declarations. By using explicit `.nuspec` files with `targetFramework=".NETFramework4.7.2"` declarations, packages now properly declare compatibility with .NET Framework 4.7.2 projects.

## Testing

- All core packages build successfully in Release mode
- Package structure verified with proper framework targeting
- Dependencies correctly declared with version constraints
